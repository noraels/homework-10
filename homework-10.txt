1. PDOs are a built in class that comes with PHP that makes it easier to interact with databases. It represents and manages
the connection to the database. Through the PDOs, PHP can take SQL as input and return results from the database and store
it in variables. A DSN (data source name) is a string that contains information about the connection to the database. They 
instantiate PDO objects.
2. .env files are files containing environment variables (variables whose values are set outside the program,
typically through a functionality built into the operating system). It will exist in the environment(OS) we are running our 
application on and set variables specific to the environment. A gitignore file is a text file that tells Git which files or 
folders to ignore in a project (such as the .env file).
3. No, sensitive/personal data should never be uploaded to github
4. An SQL injection is when a hacker tries to run malicious sql code in a database. 
5. Prepared statements are parameterized and reusable SQL queries which force the developer to write the SQL command 
and the user-provided data separately. Variables are passed to a prepared statement by using an associative array where 
the keys match the named placeholders in the query. This array is passed to the execute() method.
